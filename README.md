## üìê UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals

- Create an intuitive, mobile-first booking flow
- Maintain visual consistency across pages
- Optimize for fast loading and user experience
- Ensure accessibility for all users


### üìÑ Primary Pages

| Page                  | Description                                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Property Listing View | Grid of available properties with search and filter options |
| Listing Detailed View | Full property info with image gallery and booking form       |
| Checkout View         | Streamlined booking and payment confirmation process         |


### Importance of a user-friendly design in a booking system

A user-friendly design in a booking system is crucial because it makes the process quick, clear, and stress-free for users. When people can easily search, select, and confirm their bookings without confusion or frustration, it increases satisfaction, reduces drop-offs, and boosts trust in the service. Good design also helps minimize errors and support requests, making the system more efficient for both users and businesses.

  ### The importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design.

  Identifying the design properties of a mockup is important because it helps ensure the final product aligns with the intended user experience and brand identity. It allows designers and developers to understand key elements like layout, colors, typography, spacing, and functionality before development begins. This helps catch potential issues early, supports consistent design across screens, and improves communication within the team‚Äîultimately saving time and leading to a more polished, user-friendly final product.
